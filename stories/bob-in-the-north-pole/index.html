  <h4>
    <center style="color: blueviolet;">
      It was Saturday morning in Böb and his family's igloo.<br>He had just woken up after going to school on Friday.
      <br>
      <br>
      He was very tired because he had been at school until 5 o'clock.<br>
      Böb turned 4 today and he was already 0.6 meters tall
      <br>
      <br>
      He received a message from his friend Morgus on his mobile.<br>The email said that Morgus had also just woken up
      and
      wanted to hang out with Böb.
      <br>
      <br>
      Böb sent to morgus that he would be there at 10:10.
      He just needed to eat breakfast and brush his teeth<br>but before he left his room he noticed that it was wet on
      the
      ground and unusually hot.
      <br>
      <br>
      Böb felt a drop of water from the roof, the roof had melted because it was so hot.
      <br>
      <br>
      Böb rushed to his parents' room to tell them but they were not home.<br>Böb had forgotten that they were going to
      the South Pole center to buy him a present.
      <br>
      <br>
      Böb was going to call his mother Bubba, but she didn't bring her cell phone to the center.<br>Böb panicked and was
      about to run to Morgus's house but when he opened the door there was no ice but only water.
      <br>
      <br>
      The road had melted and Bubba couldn't drive home.<br>Böb started swimming to Morgus' house and when he got there
      he
      knocked and told what happened.<br>Morgus said they have to report to the pengulice (the police).
      <br>
      <br>
      Because the pengulice had a machine that could cool down the entire South Pole.<br>Böb called 221 and said what
      the problem was.<br><br>The pengulice said they knew about the problem but the machine had fallen into the water
      and<br>floated away to the South Pole center and there was no fast way there.
      <br>
      <br>
      Morgus realized that he lived very close to the center and that Böb and Morgus could swim and retrieve the
      machine.
      <br>
      <br>
      They started swimming to the center and finally they got there and started looking for it.<br>Böb found it
      under a block of ice that was left and they swam to the pengulice and returned it.
      <br>
      <br>
      Then everything became normal again, Bubba and Böb's father Böebois came home.<br>Böb had a great birthday and he
      and
      Morgus got a medal for what they had done.
